# Cryptotracker Web App

Crypto Lab is a web app that displays data of the top 100
crypto-currencies in real time. On the app, you can see live data for an explicit coin, 
for instance Market cap, Current Price, Volume, Rank etc. When clicking on a 
coin in the "coin-row", you will get more in depth information ablut the explicit coin. 
We have implemented a Sign In and a Sign Up page, but we did unfortunatly encounter some issues with 
fixing the backend using firebase, so at this time the Sign In and Sign Up pages do not work.
