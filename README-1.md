# Cryptotracker Web App

Crypto Lab is a web app that displays data of the top 100
Crypto-currencies in real time. On the app, you can see live data for an explicit coin, 
for instance Market cap, Current Price, Volume, Rank etc. When clicking on a 
coin in the coin-row, you will get more in-depth information about the explicit coin. 
We have also implemented a Sign In and a Sign Up page, but we did unfortunatly encounter some issues with 
fixing the backend using firebase, so at this time the Sign In and Sign Up is only for reasons of visibility.
